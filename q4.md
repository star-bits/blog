# 4-Bit Quantization 

Each weight is represented using just 4 bits. This confines the representation to 16 distinct, discrete levels.

## Quantization Procedure:

1. Determine the range of weights: The first step in the process is to establish the range within which the weights fall.
2. Map into discrete levels: Once the weight range is determined, the original continuous values are transformed into discrete levels within that range. 
3. Set intervals: Subsequently, the determined range is sectioned into 15 segments or intervals. These intervals can be uniform (equally spaced), or they can be non-uniform (logarithmic).
4. Store in a lookup table: These discrete levels, obtained after interval division, are then stored in a specific database known as a lookup table.
5. Compute: During inference, the quantized values are reconverted to their approximated real values by referencing the previously stored data in the lookup table.

## Further Details:

- Use of weight probability distribution: Instead of relying on the range, Lloyd-Max quantization utilizes the weight's probability distribution.
- Application of a conversion formula: In place of the lookup table, sometimes a conversion formula is used for calculation purposes.
- Scope of weight probability distribution: The weight's probability distribution scope can vary - it may apply to the entire model, a specific layer, or a group of similar layers.

## Model Size:

- The size of the quantized model `models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin`, which has 7 billion parameters (7B), is approximately 3.8 GB. This can be mathematically explained as: 
  (7B parameters) * (0.5 bytes per parameter) = 3.5B bytes, which is roughly equivalent to 3.3 GB.

## GGML's q4_0 and q4_1 Variants:

- The `q4_0` quantization method applies a universal scaling factor to all data values, which may lead to loss of precision for data with a large range.
- The `q4_1` quantization method includes a minimum value that can be used to more accurately handle a larger range of original data values, resulting in better preservation of relative differences and improved accuracy.

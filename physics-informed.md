# Physics-Informed Neural Networks

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) incorporate known physical laws into their architecture by adding a term to the loss function that represents the deviation from these physical laws. The loss function in a PINN has two main components: data-based loss and physics-based loss.
